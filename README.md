## Summary
Cinnamon 4 (as the successor of Cinnamon 3) is an open source general purpose, client/server content and document management platform. Cinnamon 4 can be used out of the box with the server and 
Windows Desktop Client installed, but it can also be used with less, more or different client applications, like custom web frontends and the like.

Cinnamon 4 is highly modular and flexibkle and integrates easily with third party software with APIs.

Cinnamon 4, client and server, provide a complete open source system that can be used right away without purchasing licenses. There are vendors, particularly, the project's main contributor 
[texolution](https://texolution.eu), selling modules that extend or replace open source components to provide functionality for various use cases. Here are some examples:
* Enterprise Package, a set of client and server modules adding functionality turning Cinnamon in a Component CMS for authoring of modular technical documentation in DITA or other data formats and models.
Enterprise Package features module-based and version sensitive translation management.
* Smart AI Hub is a web-based, configurable and extensible middleware managing AI prompts and models and providing flexible RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) based on your own and public data sources.
* Further applications include high-end, automatic publication of investment banking reports, or management of technical supplier documentation requests in plant engineering.
* And apart from that, you can use the platform as-is or supplemented by commercial add-ons to build your custom applications on it.
